### New requirements to expect
Some new dependencies will be required (eg. Old TFA Base) for things to work right. This will both allow development to end and everything to work as intended for the foreseeable future.

Due to Copyright uncertainty, these dependencies will *NOT* be hosted on the Steam Workshop nor here on GitHub. You'll be expected to unsubscribe from the Workshop versions.
