# What is this branch?
It's **NOT** Chronicles, it's [nZombies 1.0](https://github.com/Zet0rz/nzombies) which will have Sandbox as its Creative Mode. (All previously created configs will be compatible)

## Why?
I came up with an idea for making Creative Mode better, and this branch is my test to see if it can work. 
If it turns out to be successful, it will be included in Chronicles.

This gives config creators the freedom they have been waiting for from nZombies Unlimited. Why should nZombies have its own build mode, when Facepunch perfected that years ago along with its own Save/Load system?

## Should I download it?
If I asked for help testing, go for it! Please do. Otherwise, **NO**. It's not a standalone gamemode and therefore should not be played on.
