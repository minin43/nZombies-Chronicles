# nZombies-Chronicles
Not downloadable yet, coming soon..
______

Chronicles is a perfected version of nZombies 1.0 (https://github.com/Zet0rz/nzombies) with everything fixed and many new features introduced.
<br></br>
Getting the COD details right was important, and this was achieved after countless hours of COD Source code research (specifically BO1 and BO2) giving me a clear picture of the inner workings of the original games to accurately recreate them.
<br></br>
Getting the gamemode out of its broken and unmaintainable state was equally important, and this was also achieved with non-stop bug and exploit fixes, totalling up to 1 and a half years of hard, dedicated work.

### New requirements to expect
Some new dependencies will be required (eg. Old TFA Base) for things to work right. This will both allow development to end and everything to work as intended for the foreseeable future. 
<br></br>
Due to Copyright uncertainty, these dependencies will *NOT* be hosted on the Steam Workshop nor here on GitHub. You'll be expected to unsubscribe from the Workshop versions.
