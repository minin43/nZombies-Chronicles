* No longer holds back when chasing players (stutter/stop)
* No longer gets stuck when climbing through barriers
* Jumps to player height and attacks when a player is cheating in an unreachable spot
* Pushes self at random directions when running into an object to quickly work around it
* Respawns when too far from navmesh
* More code methods allowing better implementation of animations and other behavior inside custom enemies
