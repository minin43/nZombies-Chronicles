# Better Collisions 
   * Bullets & projectiles go through invisible walls and wall blocks properly
   * Linux no longer has the bug where players get stuck on invisible walls by simply touching them
   * Projectiles hit zombies
   * Players collide with zombies, but cannot stand on them
   * Players no longer get stuck inside things from going down or being revived
   * Players can no longer move through barricades 
   * Zombies don't collide with eachother
