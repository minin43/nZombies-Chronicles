-- Entity misc functions created by Ethorbit,
-- for functions that edit a specific entity or
-- group of entities that don't really belong in
-- the ENTITY meta table.

-- Move spawns, added because Map Scripts for maps like nz_winds need
-- the ability to change the player spawn position dynamically
-- to function as intended.
